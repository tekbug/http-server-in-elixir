# HTTP server from Scratch using Elixir

## Docs
- Robust documentation on the way for this. This will be a production-ish HTTP server that I am going to develop using Elixir. 
- [Cowboy](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy) is the inspiration.
- Basically, there is nothing fancy for now, but hopefully, there will be.
